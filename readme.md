# Merge with Deferred Execution

Testing an idea to use deferred execution to build complex interval merge processes.

The AST class can be used as an aggregator for each column during the merge process.
It could be compiled to hard python code for faster evaluation, or serialized and executed in some other faster programming language ;)
